Jupyter-sphinx is a Sphinx extension that executes embedded code in a Jupyter
kernel, and embeds outputs of that code in the document. It has support
for rich output such as images, Latex math and even javascript widgets, and
it allows to enable `thebelab <https://thebelab.readthedocs.io/>`_ for live
code execution with minimal effort.
